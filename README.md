Scripting for Libretro cores



https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c65a486a-e972-4262-b99b-36212bfa6ae1



## Why?

My initial use case was to be able to track evolution requirements for Digimon World (PS1).
Scripting support for emulators is very inconsistent.
RetroArch has [network commands](https://docs.libretro.com/development/retroarch/network-control-interface/),
but it's a barely documented, UDP only API.
Allowing external code to easily access the memory of emulated games opens up many interesting tool possibilities.
Think [RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org/) or custom [trackers](https://emotracker.net/) used by retro game randomizers.

## How?

This project implements a `retro_scripting_libretro` core that acts as a proxy to another Libretro core.
All emulation functionality is handled by the proxied core.
The proxy core starts a [jsonrpc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC) server listening on http://localhost:3030.
Any app running on the same machine can then send requests to the jsonrpc server asking for the core to execute some method,
like reading some value from the game's memory for example.

To load some content, you need to pass to retroarch

- the path to retro_scripting_libretro
- the path to the real core that will be proxied to
- the path to the game content file

like in the following example:

```
retroarch -L path/to/retro_scripting_libretro path/to/real_core_libretro?content=path/to/content_file'
```

## What?

Current features are very limited, but sufficient to implement a full game tracker. You can read either
[u8](## "unsigned 8-bit integer") or [u16](## "unsigned 16-bit integer, little endian") values from core memory:

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "read_memory",
  "params": {
    "u8": {
      "some_u8": 1234,
      "another_u8": 1235
    },
    "u16le": {
      "some_u16": 1236,
      "another_u16": 1238
    }
  },
  "id": 1337
}' 127.0.0.1:3030
```
```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"u16le":{"another_u16":4,"some_u16":3},"u8":{"another_u8":2,"some_u8":1}},"id":1337}
```


## Digimon World evolution tracker

A Digimon World (PS1) evolution requirements tracker is included in the repo under [/client](/client).
To run it, first start the game with RetroArch using the `retro_scripting_libretro` core,
point a [local web server](https://github.com/TheWaWaR/simple-http-server) to `/client` and
finally open [http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html) on your web browser.


## TODO

- Add proper logging to the jsonrpc server.
- Implement memory reading for other data types. (C strings?, Entire structs?)
- Implement memory writing?
- Extract the Digimon World evolution tracker to it's own repo.
